# Types and Functions

## Who Need Types?

## Types Are About Composability

## What Are Types?

The simplest intuition for types is that they are sets of values.

Sets can be finite or infinite.

Extend every type by one more special value called *bottom* and denoted by `_|_`. This "value" corresponds to a non-terminating computation.

```haskell
f :: Bool -> Bool

-- may return True, False or _|_
```

## Why Do We Need a Mathematical Model?

## Pure and Dirty Functions

## Examples of Types

## Challenges

```fsharp

let memoize f = 
    let mem = new Dictionary<_, _>()
    fun x ->
        if mem.ContainsKey(x) then mem.Item(x)
        else 
            let y = f x
            mem.Add(x, y)
            y

```
